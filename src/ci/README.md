## Drone CI Setup

Check [Drone documentation](https://docs.drone.io/), [Drone Vault plugin](https://readme.drone.io/extend/secrets/vault/), [Drone Docker plugin](http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-docker/) and [Awesome Drone](https://github.com/drone/awesome-drone) for more information.

### Preliminary checklist

- [x] `$REPO_ROOT`, `$SHOEBOX_ROOT`, `$YOUR_DOMAIN` environment variables are set

    ```
    $ echo $REPO_ROOT
    $ echo $SHOEBOX_ROOT
    $ echo $YOUR_DOMAIN
    ```

- [x] Drone `secrets.ini` and `.env` files are generated

    > WARNING: DO NOT modify assigned values in the `.env` file. If necessary,modify the `secrets.ini` file and run `ci_containers_setup.sh` to override the current values.

    ```
    $ sudo cat $SHOEBOX_ROOT/drone/secrets.ini
    $ sudo cat $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env
    ```

- [x] [Git](/src/git/README.md) service is up and running (git._yourdomain.com_)

- [x] [Docker](/src/registry/README.md) registry is up and running (registryui._yourdomain.com_)

- [x] [Vault](/src/vault/README.md) service is up and running and the vault is configured and [unsealed](/src/vault/README.md#unseal-vault) (vault._yourdomain.com_)

- [x] ci._yourdomain.com_ subdomain is configured and serves https traffic

Proceed if all of the checks pass, otherwise, review the [landing page](/src/README.md#setup-outline) and continue when ready.

### Setup

1. Drone Vault plugin requires a Vault client token for accessing secrets stored in the Vault service. Fetch the cline token as described [here](/src/vault/README.md#issue-a-client-token) and then replace the placeholder in `.env` file running the following command.

    > WARNING: Do not forget to replace [vault-token] with the actual value

    ```
    $ export VAULT_TOKEN=[vault-token]
    $ sudo sed -i 's|@VAULT_TOKEN|'"$VAULT_TOKEN"'|g' $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env
    $ cat $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env
    ```

2. Start Drone CI (ci), Drone build agent (ci-agent), Drone Vault plugin (ci-secret) and PostgreSQL (ci-db) containers.

      ```
      $ sudo cd $REPO_ROOT/src/ci
      $ sudo docker-compose up -d
      ```

    Run `$ sudo docker ps` for verifying if `ci`, `ci-agent`, `ci-secret` and `ci-db`  containers are up and running. Proceed if no error detected, otherwise run `$ sudo docker logs [container name]` to check the container logs for troubleshooting.

3. Prepare and run a test build. The purpose of the test build is to very if secrets can be fetched from Vault and the container produced by the build pipeline can be pushed to a private Docker registry.

    > INFO: The sample project can be found at `$REPO_ROOT/src/ci.build.sample`

    -  Create a secret for storing build arguments for the container. The secret should be created as follows:

        - Secret path (_Path for this secret_ field): `ci.build.sample`
        - Secret key/value: `hello_world`/`Hello world!`

        Follow the instruction for creating secrets as described [here](/src/vault/README.md#create-a-secret).

    -  Create a git user for the CI service for enabling access to repositories. Use the values of `DRONE_GIT_USERNAME` and `DRONE_GIT_PASSWORD` from the `secrets.ini` file as username and password accordingly. After the user is created log in to the Git service and create a repository named `ci.build.sample`.

        > IMPORTANT: For repositories not created under `DRONE_GIT_USERNAME` adding that user as a collaborator should enable access for the CI service.


    - Activate the repository for build

      - Navigate to ci._yourdomain.com_ and log in using the CI git user create earlier. If the repository is not listed click the [SYNC] button in the top right corner and wait.

        > WARNING: If the repository is still not shown after syncing use the CI git user credentials (`DRONE_GIT_USERNAME` and `DRONE_GIT_PASSWORD`) to login to the Git service and check if the repository is accessible.

      - For activating the repository click the repository name or [ACTIVATE], that should open the _SETTINGS_ tab, then click [ACTIVATE REPOSITORY] for activation. Check _Trusted_ in the _Project settings_ section and click [SAVE] to save changes.


    - Add the sample project to the repository and trigger a build.

        - Replace `@YOUR_DOMAIN` placeholder in `.drone.yml` in the project folder with the actual value to set correct links to the other services.

          > INFO: `.drone.yml` contains the build pipeline configuration for the sample project. Check the [Drone Pipeline documentation](https://docs.drone.io/configure/pipeline/) for more information.

          ```
          $ sudo sed -i 's|@YOUR_DOMAIN|'"$YOUR_DOMAIN"'|g' $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/ci.build.sample/.drone.yml
          $ cat $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/ci.build.sample/.drone.yml
          ```

      - Create a local git repository for the sample project and push it to the Git service.

        > WARNING: Do not forget to replace [yourdomain.com] and [DRONE_GIT_USERNAME] placeholders with the actual values.

        ```
        $ cd $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/ci.build.sample
        $ sudo git add .
        $ sudo git commit -m "Adding ci.build.sample"
        $ sudo git remote add origin https://git.[yourdomain.com]/[DRONE_GIT_USERNAME]/ci.build.sample
        $ sudo git remote -v
        $ sudo git push origin master
        ```

        > IMPORTANT: `git push` should trigger a build, if not then modify the `.trigger` file in the project directory, and commit and push the change fro triggering a build.

        Navigate to ci._yourdomain.com_ and click the repository name, ci.build.sample, to open the details page and then open the _ACTIVITY FEED_ tab for checking the build status.

      - If the build is successful (green (âœ“) checkmark icon) it should create a _ci.build.sample_ Docker image in the Docker registry (check `registryiu`_.yourdomain.com_). Verify the image Create a container from the image and pulling the endpoint which should display the baked-in message from the `hello_world` secret.

          > WARNING: Do not forget to replace _[yourdomain.com]_ with the actual value.

          ```
          $ sudo docker run -d -p 9080:80 --name ci.build.sample registry.[yourdomain.com]/ci.test/ci.build.sample
          $ curl http://localhost:9080/api/hello
          ```

        If the expected output is not shown consult with the troubleshooting section given further to investigate the issue in detail.

      - If the build is failed (red (X) icon) then click on the build record to open the build-log and inspect it for troubleshooting. If the failure cannot be inferred from the logs consult with the troubleshooting section given further to investigate the issue in detail

### Build failures troubleshooting

  - Set up Drone CLI

      Drone CLI is used for managing the service, running local builds and triggering rebuilding on the service if necessary. Check the [Drone CLI documentation](https://docs.drone.io/cli/) for more information.

    - Install Drone CLI

        ```
        $ curl -L https://github.com/drone/drone-cli/releases/latest/download/
        $ drone_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar zx
        $ sudo install -t /usr/local/bin drone 
        ```

    - Drone CLI requires the Drone admin user for running commands on the Drone service. The credential for the admin user can be extracted from the `DRONE_USER_CREATE` parameter from the `secrets.ini` file. Use the _username_ and _token_ parts to create a git user with matching username and password.

    - Drone CLI requires `DRONE_TOKEN` and `DRONE_SERVER`environment variables to before connecting to the Drone service. Conveniently, the commands to set those variables can be fetched from the Drone web interface. Use the admin user credentials to log in to the Drone web interface. In the landing page click on the user icon (auto-generated icon with an abstract pattern in the top right corner), and then click _User Settings_ in the emerged context menu. In the opened page find the _Example CLI Usage_ section and copy-paste its content into the shell and run the commands.

      > INFO: The commands should resemble the following piece of code
        ```
        $ export DRONE_SERVER=https://ci.[yourdomain.com]
        $ export DRONE_TOKEN=[ci-agent-token]
        ```

    - Check if the connection to the service can be established by running the following command.

      ```
      $ sudo drone info
      ```

      The output should contain the user information if connected or error text if failed.

- Troubleshooting


  The most fragile step of the build pipeline is `containerize`. It consists of two operations dependent on external services

    - Fetching secrets from Vault using the Drone secrets plugin

        ```
        $ drone plugins secret get secrets/data/ci.docker registry_username --repo ciagent/ci.build.sample
        $ drone plugins secret get secrets/data/ci.build.sample hello_world --repo ciagent/ci.build.sample
        ```

        If correct secret values are displayed the cause of the issue is not related to the secrets plugin or Vault configuration, otherwise check `VAULT_TOKEN` by trying to login using its value and confirm that Access Login Policy is configured correctly as described [here](/src/vault/README.md#acl-policy).


    - Pushing a resulting Docker image to the Docker registry

      - Check if the registry can be accessed by the provided username and password values ([here](/src/registry/README.md#docker-registry-username-and-password))

      - Check if the registry virtual host file has been amended as described [here](/README.md#modify-registry-vhost-config).
