## Drone CI Setup

Check [Drone documentation](https://docs.drone.io/), [Drone Vault plugin](https://readme.drone.io/extend/secrets/vault/), [Drone Docker plugin](http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-docker/), and [Awesome Drone](https://github.com/drone/awesome-drone) for more information.

### Preliminary checklist

- [x] `$REPO_ROOT`, `$SHOEBOX_ROOT`, `$YOUR_DOMAIN` environment variables are set

    ```
    $ echo $REPO_ROOT
    $ echo $SHOEBOX_ROOT
    $ echo $YOUR_DOMAIN
    ```

- [x] Drone `secrets.ini` and `.env` files are generated

    ```
    $ sudo cat $SHOEBOX_ROOT/ci-drone/secrets.ini
    $ sudo cat $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env
    ```

- [x] [Git](/src/git/README.md) service is up and running (git._yourdomain.com_)

- [x] [Docker](/src/registry/README.md) registry is up and running (registryui._yourdomain.com_)

- [x] [Vault](/src/vault/README.md) service is up and running, and the vault is configured and [unsealed](/src/vault/README.md#unseal-vault) (vault._yourdomain.com_)

- [x] ci._yourdomain.com_ subdomain is configured and serves https traffic

Proceed if all of the checks pass, otherwise, review the [landing page](/src/README.md#setup-outline) and continue when ready.

### Setup

1. Drone Vault plugin requires a Vault client token for accessing secrets stored in the Vault service. Check if the `$VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable is assigned by running the following command `$ echo $VAULT_TOKEN`. If not, fetch the Vault client token and set the variable as described [here](/src/vault/README.md#issue-a-client-token) before continuing. Replace the placeholder in the `.env` file by running the following command.

    ```
    
    $ sudo sed -i 's|@VAULT_TOKEN$|'"$VAULT_TOKEN"'|g' $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env
    $ cat $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env # verify the result
    ```

2. Start Drone CI (`ci`), Drone build agent (`ci-agent`), Drone Vault plugin (`ci-secret-plugin`), and PostgreSQL (`ci-db`) containers.

      ```
      $ cd $REPO_ROOT/src/ci
      $ sudo docker-compose up -d
      ```

    Run `$ sudo docker ps | grep ci` to verify if the containers listed above are up and running. Proceed if no error detected, otherwise run `$ sudo docker logs [container name]` to check the container logs for troubleshooting.

3. Prepare and run a test build. The purpose of the test build is to very if secrets can be fetched from Vault, and the container produced by the build pipeline can be pushed to a private Docker registry.

    -  Create a git user for the CI service for enabling access to repositories. Use the values of `DRONE_GIT_USERNAME` and `DRONE_GIT_PASSWORD` from the `secrets.ini` file as username and password accordingly. After the user is created, make sure that the user has the setting: "This account has permissions to create Git Hooks" enabled. Log into the Git service and create a repository named `ci.build.sample`.

        > IMPORTANT: To enables access for the CI service for repositories not created under `DRONE_GIT_USERNAME` add that user as an admin collaborator.

    - Activate the repository for build

      - Navigate to ci._yourdomain.com_ and log in using the CI git user create earlier. If the repository is not listed, click the [SYNC] button in the top right corner and wait.

        > WARNING: If the repository is still not shown after syncing, use the CI git user credentials (`DRONE_GIT_USERNAME` and `DRONE_GIT_PASSWORD`) to log into the Git service and check if the repository is accessible.

      - For activating the repository, click the repository name or [ACTIVATE], which should open the _SETTINGS_ tab. Then, click [ACTIVATE REPOSITORY] for activation.

    - Add the sample project to the repository and trigger a build.

        - Run the following commands to replace the `@YOUR_DOMAIN` placeholder in `.drone.yml` file with the actual value for forming correct links to external services.

          ```
          $ sudo sed -i 's|@YOUR_DOMAIN|'"$YOUR_DOMAIN"'|g' $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/ci.build.sample/.drone.yml
          $ cat $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/ci.build.sample/.drone.yml # verify the result
          ```

          > INFO: `.drone.yml` contains a build pipeline configuration for the sample project. Check the [Drone Pipeline documentation](https://docs.drone.io/configure/pipeline/) for more information.

      - Create a local git repository for the sample project and push its content to the Git service.

        ```
        $ cd $REPO_ROOT/src/ci/ci.build.sample
        $ sudo git init
        $ sudo git add .
        $ sudo git commit -m "Adding ci.build.sample"
        $ source $SHOEBOX_ROOT/ci-drone/secrets.ini # load $DRONE_GIT_USERNAME and $DRONE_GIT_PASSWORD variables
        $ sudo git remote add origin https://$DRONE_GIT_USERNAME:$DRONE_GIT_PASSWORD@git.$YOUR_DOMAIN/$DRONE_GIT_USERNAME/ci.build.sample.git
        $ sudo git remote -v # check remote
        $ sudo git push origin master
        ```

        > IMPORTANT: `git push` should trigger a build by default. If the build is not triggered, modify the `.trigger` file in the project directory and, commit and push the changes for triggering a new build.

    - Navigate to ci._yourdomain.com_ and click the repository name, _ci.build.sample_, to open the details page and then open the _ACTIVITY FEED_ tab for checking the build status.

      - If the build is successful (green (âœ“) check icon), it should create a _ci.build.sample_ Docker image in the Docker registry (check `registryiu`_.yourdomain.com_). Verify the build result as follows:

        Log into the private registry by running the following commands.

          ```
          $ source $SHOEBOX_ROOT/registry-docker/secrets.ini # load $REGISTRY_USERNAME and $REGISTRY_PASSWORD variables
          $ sudo docker login registry.$YOUR_DOMAIN --username $REGISTRY_USERNAME --password $REGISTRY_PASSWORD
          ```

        Create a container from the published Docker image, and pull the endpoint for fetching the baked-in message from the `hello_world` secret.

        ```
        $ sudo docker run -d -p 9080:80 --name ci.build.sample registry.$YOUR_DOMAIN/ci.test/ci.build.sample
        $ curl http://localhost:9080/api/hello
        ```

        If the expected output is not shown, consult with the troubleshooting section below to investigate the issue.

      - If the build is failed (red (X) icon), open and inspect the build log for troubleshooting. The build-log can be accessed by clicking on the build record. If the failure cannot be inferred from the logs, check the troubleshooting section below to investigate the issue.


### Build failures troubleshooting

  - Set up Drone CLI

      Drone CLI is used for managing the Drone service, running local builds, and triggering builds remotely if necessary. Check the [Drone CLI documentation](https://docs.drone.io/cli/) for more information.

    - Install Drone CLI

        ```
        $ curl -L https://github.com/drone/drone-cli/releases/latest/download/drone_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar zx
        $ sudo install -t /usr/local/bin drone
        ```

    - Drone CLI requires the Drone admin user for running commands on the Drone service. The credential for the admin user can be extracted from the `DRONE_USER_CREATE` parameter from the `secrets.ini` file. Use the _username_ and _token_ parts to create a git user with matching username and password values.

    - Drone CLI requires `DRONE_TOKEN` and `DRONE_SERVER` environment for connecting to the Drone service. Conveniently, those variables can be fetched from the Drone web interface. Use the admin user credentials to log in to the Drone web interface. On the landing page, click on the user icon (auto-generated icon with an abstract pattern in the top right corner) and then click _User Settings_ in the emerged context menu. In the opened page find the _Example CLI Usage_ section and copy-paste its content into the shell and run the commands.

      Check if the variables are set bu running the following commands:

        ```
        $ echo DRONE_SERVER
        $ echo DRONE_TOKEN
        ```

    - Check if the connection to the Drone service can be established by running the following command:

      ```
      $ sudo drone info
      ```

      The output should contain the user information if connected or error text if failed.

- Troubleshooting

  The most fragile step of the build pipeline is `containerize` as it depends on external services - Vault and Docker Registry.

    - Check if secrets can be fetched by the Drone Vault plugin

        Replace the placeholders with matching values from `$REPO_ROOT/src/ci/.env` an set the environment values as follows.

        ```
        $ export DRONE_SECRET_ENDPOINT=http://[DRONE_VAULT_PLUGIN_PORT_BINDING]
        $ export DRONE_SECRET_SECRET=[DRONE_SECRET]
        ```

        Check if the build argument is accessible.

        ```
        $ drone plugins secret get secrets/data/ci.build.sample hello_world --repo ciagent/ci.build.sample
        ```

        Check if the Docker Registry credentials are accessible.

        ```
        $ drone plugins secret get secrets/data/ci.registry registry_username --repo ciagent/ci.build.sample
        $ drone plugins secret get secrets/data/ci.registry registry_password --repo ciagent/ci.build.sample
        ```

        > WARNING: Be aware not to confuse the CLI to secret plugin communication or configurations errors. Secret access issues reported as the _secret key not found_ or _secret not found_ error messages.

        If the secret values cannot check if the secrets are accessible by the generated token (`VAULT_TOKEN`) as described [here](/src/vault/README.md#read-secret).

    - Check if the registry can be accessed by the using the username and password values as described [here](/src/registry/README.md#docker-registry-username-and-password).
